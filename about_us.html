					<img src="img/Family Pic.webp" class="about" alt="">
					<p>I was raised on our family farm in the plains of eastern Montana where the motto seemed to be “work hard and then work some more and, if you could keep your eyes open, play hard”.  I learned that you honor God, treasure your family, your handshake meant something, and common sense was … well - common. Honor, respect, and integrity were mandatory to becoming a man.</p>
					
					<p>Growing up - well, I've never really grown up, so - being raised on a farm, the outdoors was my life.  From herding cows to picking rock and everything in between was done outside.  Hunting became not only a chance to provide food, but it was also well deserved “me time”.  My first rifle was a hand-me-down pre-64 Winchester model 70 30.06 that my Great Grandpa gave me.  This rifle and I have had many adventures that helped develop my love for hunting and shooting. This love, however; was trumped when I met a girl.  Fast forward 20 years and she is now my wife that has supported me in all my crazy ideas and business adventures, homeschooled all four of our beautiful children, and still finds it in her heart to love and take excellent care of me - I am the LUCKIEST man alive.</p>

					<p>Over the course of time, I have been able to develop my long-distance shooting skills and even build a few custom rifles.  I have learned some very valuable lessons about shooting, reading wind, reloading, finding imperfections in firearms, and how important knowledge and safety is.  Now is the time for me to help others on their journey, so I decided to start Dangerous Freedom.</p>

					<p>Growing up in a small town in North central Montana, we always had guns around us. Whether it was learning how to hunt and shoot with dad or shooting clay pigeons on the fourth of July. After Highschool I moved around between southern and eastern Montana and ended up in Williston ND working in the oil field for about 12 years. After some medical difficulties I decided to move over to western MT where my parents and brother reside. Here is where my passion for guns was regained and I enrolled in Sonoran Desert Institute for gunsmithing. I have been on the dean's list and finishing classes with above average grades. I will be completing school in October with an Associate's degree in science. I am passionate about firearms of all kinds and really enjoy studying and testing ballistics and how to get a gun to shoot to its maximum potential.</p> 
					<p>A challenge accepted is one step closer to achieving excellence.</p>

					<p>Dangerous Freedom was built on the same values that I was taught as a kid - Honor, Respect, and Integrity.</p>

					<p>At Dangerous Freedom, we realize that our 2nd amendment rights are under attack.  This has led me to develop Dangerous Freedom into not only a gun store but an avenue for knowledge and training.</p>

					<p>Dangerous Freedom offers a variety of services; everything from sharpening your hunting knife to hydro-dipping you AR15, but we will also have seminars and training for everyone form beginner to advanced marksman.  You can follow our Facebook and YouTube pages to find tips and tricks for working on your firearms, links to current events related to the 2nd amendment, and even some videos of us trying our hand at living the dream.</p>
