					<img src="img/Family Pic.webp" class="about" alt="">
					<p>I was raised on our family farm in the plains of eastern Montana where the motto seemed to be “work hard and then work some more and, if you could keep your eyes open, play hard”.  I learned that you honor God, treasure your family, your handshake meant something, and common sense was … well - common. Honor, respect, and integrity were mandatory to becoming a man.</p>
					
					<p>Growing up - well, I've never really grown up, so - being raised on a farm, the outdoors was my life.  From herding cows to picking rock and everything in between was done outside.  Hunting became not only a chance to provide food, but it was also well deserved “me time”.  My first rifle was a hand-me-down pre-64 Winchester model 70 30.06 that my Great Grandpa gave me.  This rifle and I have had many adventures that helped develop my love for hunting and shooting. This love, however; was trumped when I met a girl.  Fast forward 20 years and she is now my wife that has supported me in all my crazy ideas and business adventures, homeschooled all four of our beautiful children, and still finds it in her heart to love and take excellent care of me - I am the LUCKIEST man alive.</p>

					<p>Over the course of time, I have been able to develop my long-distance shooting skills and even build a few custom rifles.  I have learned some very valuable lessons about shooting, reading wind, reloading, finding imperfections in firearms, and how important knowledge and safety is.  Now is the time for me to help others on their journey, so I decided to start Dangerous Freedom.</p>

					<p>Dangerous Freedom was built on the same values that I was taught as a kid - Honor, Respect, and Integrity.</p>

					<p>At Dangerous Freedom, we realize that our 2nd amendment rights are under attack.  This has led me to develop Dangerous Freedom into not only a gun store but an avenue for knowledge and training.</p>

					<p>Dangerous Freedom offers a variety of services; everything from sharpening your hunting knife to hydro-dipping you AR15, but we will also have seminars and training for everyone form beginner to advanced marksman.  You can follow our Facebook and YouTube pages to find tips and tricks for working on your firearms, links to current events related to the 2nd amendment, and even some videos of us trying our hand at living the dream.</p>
